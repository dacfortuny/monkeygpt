Every enemy I've met I've annihilated!|My attacks have left entire islands depopulated!
You're as repulsive as a monkey in a negligee.|You have the sex appeal of a Shar-Pei.
Killing you would be justifiable homicide!|When I'm done, your body will be rotted and putrified!
You're the ugliest monster ever created!|Your looks would make pigs nauseated.
I'll skewer you like a sow at a buffet!|Your lips look like they belong on catch of the day!
Would you like to be buried, or cremated?|I give you a choice. You can be gutted, or decapitated!
Coming face to face with me must leave you petrified!|Never before have I seen someone so sissified!
When your father first saw you, he must have been mortified!|You're a disgrace to your species, you're so undignified!
You can't match my witty repartee!|Nothing can stop me from blowing you away!
I have never seen such clumsy swordplay!|I have never lost to a melee!
En garde! Touch√©!|Your mother wears a toupee!
Throughout the Caribbean, my great deeds are celebrated!|My skills with a sword are highly venerated!
I can't rest 'til you've been exterminated!|Your stench would make an outhouse cleaner irritated!
I'll leave you devastated, mutilated, and perforated!|I can't tell you which of my traits leaves you most intimidated.
Heaven preserve me! You look like something that's died!|Nothing on this Earth can save your sorry hide!
I'll hound you night and day!|You'll find I am dogged and relentless to my prey!
